## Requirements

Python libraries: See [environment.yml](environment.yml) for library dependencies. The conda environment can be set up using these commands:

```.bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n DiffusionPDE
conda activate DiffusionPDE
```

## Data Generation

All training datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z4ypsU3JdkAsoY9Px-JSw9RS2f5StNv5/view?usp=sharing) and all test datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdkeCKMLvDN_keIBTijOFYrRcA3Quy0l/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the ``training.zip`` folder and the ``testing.zip`` folder in the ``data/`` directory. You can also directly access data files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YbTCcBE6HlUuYNGuf2QVGfbmfTOi3_My?usp=sharing).

Datasets of Darcy Flow, Poisson equation, and Helmholtz equation are of the shape [N, X, Y], where N is the number of instances, and X, Y are spatial resolutions. Datasets of non-bounded and bounded Navier-Stokes equation are of the shape [N, X, Y, T] where T is the number of time steps. Datasets of Burgers' equation are of the shape [N, X, T].

Data generation codes for bounded Navier Stokes equation are derived from [2D Fliud Simulator](https://github.com/takah29/2d-fluid-simulator), and codes for other PDEs are available in the ``dataset_generation`` folder. Specifically, we implemented our data generation over [FNO](https://neuraloperator.github.io/neuraloperator/dev/index.html) and modified the code to introduce more finite difference methods for the Poisson equation and the Helmholtz equation.

## Train Diffusion Models

All pre-trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w4V0o-nTjpHP_Xv32Rt_SgPGmVa9PwL_/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the ``pretrained-models.zip`` in the root directory.

Our training script is derived from [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm). To train a new diffusion model on the joint distribution, use, e.g.,

```python
# Prepare the .npy files for training. 
# Raw data in the datasets should be scaled to (-1, 1).
python3 merge_data.py # Darcy Flow

# Train the diffusion model.
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=3 train.py --outdir=pretrained-darcy-new --data=/data/Darcy-merged/ --cond=0 --arch=ddpmpp --batch=60 --batch-gpu=20 --tick=10 --snap=50 --dump=100 --duration=20 --ema=0.05
```

## Solve Forward Problem

To solve the forward problem with sparse observation on the coefficient (or initial state) space, use, e.g.,

```python
python3 generate_pde.py --config configs/darcy-forward.yaml
```

### Solve Inverse Problem

To solve the inverse problem with sparse observation on the solution (or final state) space, use, e.g.,

```python
python3 generate_pde.py --config configs/darcy-inverse.yaml
```

## Recover Both Spaces With Observation On Both Sides

To simultaneously solve coefficient (initial state) space and solution (final state) space with sparse observations on both sides, use, e.g.,

```python
python3 generate_pde.py --config configs/darcy.yaml
```

## Solve Solution Over Time

To recover the solution throughout a time interval with sparse sensors, use, e.g.,

```python
python3 generate_pde.py --config configs/burgers.yaml
```
